# Lab 8

## Lab_08-1.malware
* What anti-disassembly techniques are used in the binary?
  * A lot of jump indirection to break apart functions
  * Calls a function by pushing its address onto the stack and returning, obfuscating control flow

* What anti-debugging techniques are used in the binary?
  * Counting the number of clock cycles and exiting if it's been running for too long
  * Also calls `IsDebuggerPresent`, and exiting if it returns true.
    * Runs this check twice? Jumps to this call if the clock cycles are too high.

* What does the sample do?
  * Writes a batch file that shuts down the computer and adds it to the Windows Startup folder.
