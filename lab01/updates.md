## Issues

the solution for lab1C says that it cannot be unpacked because it is not packed with upx, yet the solution references strings which don't exist in the binary as is. We were able to manually unpack the malware with a debugger and recover the strings that way, but the solution seems to be misleading



## Future Updates

1. The installation instructions should be updated to use FLARE VM from FireEye, as it streamlines the installation process considerably. 
   1. Due to how outdated windows 7 is (even with service packs), we needed to follow [this post](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-7-wont-update-error-80072efe/d6defe11-ce35-4fbf-a6da-2dc2921531ef ) to get windows update working
